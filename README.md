# Zero-Knowledge-Proofs-in-Rust
**iN progresss**)
Project Description:

This GitHub project showcases a powerful implementation of the Zero-Knowledge Proof concept in the Rust programming language. Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a cryptographic technique that allows one party, the Prover, to convince another party, the Verifier, of the truth of a statement without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement. In this project, we'll dive into a practical example that demonstrates this concept by utilizing finite fields, public parameters, and secret values.

Conceptual Overview:

In this specific implementation, the Prover and Verifier interact to prove knowledge of a secret value 'x' without revealing 'x' itself. The process involves the use of public parameters, which are alpha, beta, q, and p, where:

Alpha (α), Beta (β), q, and p are publicly known values.
Alpha, Beta, q, and p are part of a finite field.
The Prover holds a private and random value 'k', while the Verifier has a random and private challenge 'c'. The goal is for the Prover to convince the Verifier of the knowledge of 'x' without revealing it.

Workflow:

Prover's Task:

The Prover calculates the value 's' as follows: s = (k - c * x) mod q.
The Prover sends 's' to the Verifier.
Verifier's Task:

The Verifier receives 's' from the Prover.
The Verifier computes two values, 'r1' and 'r2', as follows:
r1 = alpha^s * beta^c mod p
r2 = alpha^k mod p
Verification:

The Verifier checks if r1 is equal to r2. If this equality holds, the Verifier is convinced that the Prover knows 'x' without knowing 'x' itself.
The power of this implementation lies in its ability to establish a mathematical proof without revealing the private value 'x'. This concept is incredibly useful in various applications, such as authentication, password recovery, and privacy-preserving computations.
